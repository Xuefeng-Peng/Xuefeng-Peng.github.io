Brief Introduction
======
I am Ph.D. Student under the supervision of Prof. Shaofu Du in School of Management at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and I am also a Visiting Student Researcher under the supervision of Prof. Jungju Yu in KAIST. 

My research interest focuses on the interplay between Operations Management, Marketing, and Information Design. I have published three papers and am working on several projects targeting UTD 24. Besides the academic area, I am really into tennis (4.0 level) and reading.
